This is a simple qgis-plugin that imports geodata from a Field Desktop project into a vector layer in memory. It is an ad hoc solution produced for myself to accomplish a specific task and has no error handling right now. It works, and you could try it, but it is very fragile. 

# Dependencies
The python packages `requests` and `json` need to be available.
